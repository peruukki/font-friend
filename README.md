FontFriend
============

Matt Wiebe made this bookmarklet in 2009 for web designers who want to rapidly check how different fonts and font styles look on their screen. 
Trying to develop good-looking font stacks is what prompted its creation, and he thought he’d share with the web design community.
Dave Crossland tweaked it in 2016 to work, as its previous web host (Google Code) went offline.
