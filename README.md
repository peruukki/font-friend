FontFriend
============

Matt Wiebe made this bookmarklet in 2009 for web designers who want to rapidly check how different fonts and font styles look on their screen. 
Trying to develop good-looking font stacks is what prompted its creation, and he thought heâ€™d share with the web design community.
Dave Crossland tweaked it in 2016 to work, as its previous web host (Google Code) went offline.

**This is a fork of [davelab6/font-friend](https://github.com/davelab6/font-friend) that works on sites that use jQuery 3.**
The upstream repository uses the [`.size()` method](https://api.jquery.com/size/) that has been removed in jQuery 3.0, so
it has been replaced with the `.length` property in this repository.
